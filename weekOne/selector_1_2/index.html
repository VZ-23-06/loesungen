        <p>He taught me a code. To survive. Keep your mind limber. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Rorschach would say
            you have a hard time relating to others. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the

        <p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a
            spaceship. Saving the world with meals on wheels. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the
            Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
