            I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You know when grown-ups
            tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably
            lying to make you feel better? Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't
            stand for it. Not now
        </p>

            I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And
            that is not how I'm introducing myself. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!
            You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Father Christmas.
            Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

            Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do
            you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you
            basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? Aw, you're
            all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

            Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I'm
            nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time
            you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. You know when grown-ups tell
            you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying
            to make you feel better?

            I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call
            me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Father Christmas. Santa
            Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face
            today.

            You've swallowed a planet! You've swallowed a planet! *Insistently* Bow
            ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal
            blokes do! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad
            things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but
            vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and
            make them unimportant.
