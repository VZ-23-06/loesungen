    <h1>I don't want to be rescued.</h1>
    <p>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it,
        making people wait behind me while I complain. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidatesâ€¦ PUNY HUMAN NUMBER
        ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
